# CITRINEFECHALLENGE

The first step in development would be to create backend endpoints, deploy and then test on the front end. I started with first getting the data from the backend and then setting state within the useCandidates custom hook. This state was then sent to the plot component by way of app. A useEffect was added to useCandidates hook to retrieve the full candidate list on mount. I then created a table which rendered the list along with a checkbox for each candidate. On checkbox click, putCandidate async function is called, followed by fetchCandidates to retrieve the updated list. This functionality was also added when a user clicks any plot point, in order to make both the list and plot interactive. If a plot point is clicked, the matching candidate in the list will be checked, and vice versa. 

After 5 points are selected, all remaining plot points turn gray, as the max selection has been reached. The process took a bit longer than 2 hrs, as I first had to do a little research on plotly and custom hooks with async functions. One test is not passing, however I reached the 2hr mark and am more familiar with jest than react testing library. With more time I would like to fix that last test, add sorting in the list e.g. by score, and add functionality to allow the user to change the ingredient plotted on the x-axis.
